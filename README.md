# Refactoring Guru - Design Patterns

## Introduction

This repo exists as a series of exercises as an aid for the design
patterns listed on https://refactoring.guru

The structure of the repo is as follows:

```
* exercise-plans - where all exercises are created/planned in markdown, language agnostic, and versioned
  * structural
  * behavioural
  * creational

* (a specific language here) eg. typescript
  * structural
  * behavioural
  * creational
```

You may also notice a `misc` category. This is where we include some
additional refactoring exercises that do not neatly fit into either just
one of the existing techniques, or employ a number of different
techniques to complete the refactoring.

## Instructions

Copy the repo and begin working through the specific exercises.

A copy of each lesson plan will be included inside of the specific
language/pattern folder so that instructions are easily accessible and
correct for the exercise you are working on.

## Contributions

Feel free to update/change any of the existing exercise plans or to
create new ones. This repo is intended as a place for us to learn some
of these patterns and how to implement them appropriately in our
projects.
